## This is an Ansible Tutorial from Learn Linux TV

Any playbooks in this Ansible Repository are connected to test lab servers.

As a result any IP addresses in the inventory may need to be modified.

NOTE: All of my notes that I have taken during this tutorial can be found in the `/ansible_tutorial/docs` directory.
